  - Better RTL support
  - Dynamic theming capabilities
  - Component-scoped styles
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library
  - Industry standard
  - Good component testing capabilities
  - Snapshot testing support

### Rationale
1. React.js provides:
   - Mature ecosystem for complex UI development
   - Strong RTL support through libraries like react-intl
   - Excellent performance characteristics
   - Large pool of Arabic-speaking developers

2. Vite offers:
   - Superior development experience
   - Fast hot module replacement

## [2025-04-10] - Project Structure

### Context
Need to organize the project in a scalable and maintainable way that supports multiple content types and features.

### Decision
Implement a feature-based architecture:
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── common/
│   ├── layout/
│   └── features/
├── hooks/
├── pages/
├── services/
├── styles/
└── utils/
```

### Rationale
1. Feature-based organization:
   - Better separation of concerns
   - Easier to maintain and scale
   - Clear boundaries between features
   - Supports team collaboration

2. Shared resources:
   - Common components for reusability
   - Centralized styling system
   - Shared utilities and hooks

### Implementation Plan
1. Create directory structure
2. Set up base files
3. Create documentation
4. Implement initial components
