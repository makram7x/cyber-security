## Current Focus
Completed modification of the Events page data. Next steps involve updating routing, sourcing images, and potentially further refining the Events, Media, or News pages.

## Open Questions
1. Which React component library would best support RTL layouts? (Still relevant)
2. Should we implement a headless CMS or build a custom solution? (Still relevant)
3. What caching strategy should we use for media content? (Still relevant)
4. Are placeholder images acceptable for now, or should specific images be sourced for each news item?

## Next Actions
1. Update routing in `App.jsx` to remove links to deleted pages (Reports, Articles).
2. Source or create appropriate images for the news items added to the News page.
3. Review/refine styling for the simplified Media page.
4. Review and potentially refine styling for the News page.
5. Further review/refine Events page styling if needed.
